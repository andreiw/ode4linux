ODE 4 Linux
===========

This gets the OSF Open Development Environment tools building on a recent
Linux with a recent GCC (4.8).

It's unclear how functional any of the tools are. But it does build on x64.
A lot of code cleanup is necessary - ideally this should build without any
warnings.

Building
========

You need the obvious - gcc, typical libs, groff, nothing crazy.

Run ./build.sh. The output is under obj/${context} where
${context} is at386_linux for x86 and x64.
