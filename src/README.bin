This README.bin describes the ODE 2.3.4 binary distributions that currently
reside on the FTP server under riftp.osf.org:/pub/ode/bin.

This subdirectory contains the partial result of the installation phase of
the build process, as created by the install.sh script.  The install pass
creates and populates the subdirectories ./bin ./doc ./man and ./server
under the install path argument, TOSTAGE.  For further information,
please refer to the ODE System Administrators Guide (SAG).

The ./doc and ./man subdirectories (containing the ODE System Administration
Guide, and User's Guide with manual pages) are not included here.  This
documentation is located in the ../doc subdirectory (parallel to this
./bin subdirectory).

In addition, 2 extra subdirectories are included here that are NOT part of
the install pass: sample build logs for reference (under ./logs), and RCS
binaries for selected platforms, provided for convenience (under ./rcs).

The executables are organized under subdirectories using the context name
of each platform, in the form "<target_machine>_<o/s>".  For example,
"hp700_hpux" is the context name for the Hewlett-Packard HP9000/7XX series
workstations running HP-UX.  (Consult the top level README.top or the
ODE System Administration Guide for the current list of supported
hardware platforms and operating system versions).

There are one or more subdirectories for each context name:

./logs		log files from building all tools -- not part of 
		the install pass, but included here for reference
./bin:		client (or user) side tools
./server	(RCS or source control server) side tools
./rcs		RCS executables - provided here for completeness,
		but not part of the install pass

At OSF, the client side user commands (the branch cmds) are installed in a 
common directory for all users to access via the PATH environment variable.
Both the server side and RCS binaries are installed on one or more (RCS) 
source control servers.

For example, the client side tools (located in /usr/local/ode/bin at OSF)
include the following:

% ls /usr/local/ode/bin
bci            bmerge         make           oxm_relay_tcp  sup
bco            bstat          makepath       rcsdiff3       supscan
bcreate        bsubmit        md             release        upgrade
bcs            build          mklinks        resb           uptodate
bdiff          currentsb      mksb           sadmin         workon
blog           genpath        odexm_cli      sbinfo


You can check the revision of b-tools using the "-version" switch:

% /usr/local/ode/bin/bci -version
program :  bci
release :  ODE 2.3.4
libode  :  Tue May 23 17:30:30 EDT 1995

This client side path (e.g. /usr/local/ode/bin) should be located at the
beginning of the PATH for each user.  The subdirectory must contain the
correct tools for the appropriate context name (<target machine>_<o/s>).
(Distributed file systems such as AFS/DFS automatically resolve pathnames
like /usr/local/ode/bin using the correct context name).

The ODE server side contains the following tools (e.g., on one RCS server
at OSF):

% ls /u1/ode2.3.4tools 
bco_s          bstat_s        diff3          rcs            srcacl
bcs_s          bsubmit_s      logsubmit      rcsacl         supfilesrv
blog_s         ci             odexm          rcsdiff        supscan
bmerge_s       co             odexm.map      rcsstat
branch_ci      diff           oxm_relay_tcp  rlog

The server side tools are referenced by the odexm.conf file that resides
on the server, as described in the ODE System Administration Guide (SAG).
