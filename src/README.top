README.top						 5/26/1995

Introduction:
------------

This README.top describes the top level ODE 2.3.4 distribution, as
currently organized on the FTP server riftp.osf.org.  There are
additional README files with more detail under the ./src, ./doc,
and ./bin subdirectories.

These README files correspond to the current release of ODE 2.3.4A Spring 1995.
The instructions below describe how to retrieve and unload the compressed tar
archives for this distribution.  Refer to the ODE System Administration 
Guide (SAG), for complete porting, building and installation instructions.

Compressed source code tar archives are located in the /pub/ode/src
subdirectory on the server riftp.osf.org (130.105.99.2).  PostScript versions
of the ODE documents reside in riftp.osf.org:/pub/ode/doc.  ODE binaries
can be found under riftp.osf.org:/pub/ode/bin organized per platform
(where available).

The remainder of this README.top file describes the compressed source 
code archives.


Compressed Tar Archives on ri.ftp.org:/pub/ode/src:
--------------------------------------------------

The ODE source code is logically separated into 2 archives: the original 
2.3.4 release and patches/enhancements used by the RI.  For convenience,
we have also provided an additional source archive locally with the
current revision control system (RCS 5.6).  The RCS distribution is
available from FSF and several mirror FTP sites.

   ARCHIVE                  DESCRIPTION                   SIZE        SIZE 

234src.1.tar.Z	Primarily the ODE 2.3.4 release of	 ~1.9M       ~5.3M 
		1 year ago with additional changes
		for porting to other platforms
		(source and doc files to build).

234src.2.tar.Z	Enhancements added to ODE 2.3.4 by	 ~240K       ~690K 
		OSF RI (source and doc files to 
		build).

rcs5.6.tar.Z	RCS 5.6 and diff utilities.		 ~700K	     ~1.8M



Accessing & Unloading Compressed ODE Source Archives:
----------------------------------------------------

Previous versions of the ODE System Administration Guide (SAG section 1.1.2,
page 6, step #5) direct you to:

- - - - - - - - - SAG excerpt for extracting tar archives - - - - - - - - - - -

5. Use tar to unload the ODE archive

	tar xvpf /dev/<non-rewinding tape device>

If the tar completes without errors, proceed to the next section on
building ODE.

A copy of the ODE SAG is not required to follow these instructions, although
you may subsequently wish to refer to the SAG when building the ODE sources.

The two compressed tar source archives can be combined to form a complete
source tree, or the original compressed tar archive can be built alone.

If you would like to match as closely as possible the previous release of 
ODE 2.3.4 (originally released a year ago), then you need only extract the
first compressed tar archive, 234src.1.tar.Z.  To include the ODE enhancements
and modifications made by the OSF Research Institute, you should also untar
the 2nd compressed tar archive, 234src.2.tar.Z and overlay the contents
on top of the tree obtained from the first archive.  In other words,
the ODE 2.3.4A Spring 1995 source tree, as currently used by OSF RI,
is obtained by first extracting 234src.1.tar (a fully populated ODE archive)
followed by extracting 234src.2.tar (a partial ODE patch archive) within
the same full ODE source tree.

Please consult the table above to ensure that there is enough disk space on
your system to accommodate both the compressed archives (retrieved via FTP)
and the uncompressed, fully expanded ODE source tree.

Change your working directory to the destination where the ODE sources will
reside.  This path is denoted as <ode-source> and this path is assumed to
end in a directory named "ode".  For example, if you wanted to store the
ODE sources under a subdirectory named /usr/local, the pathname for
<ode-source> might be "/usr/local/ode".

% zcat < 234src.1.tar.Z | tar xvpf -

This command will uncompress and extract the sources with verbose output.
(The full list of the archive contents is shown at the end of this note).

% ls -a
./               .sandboxrc       234src.2.tar.Z   src/
../              234src.1.tar.Z   rc_files/

As mentioned above, the 2nd source archive can be overlaid directly
on top of the full ODE tree (created by extracting the 1st source archive).
This will provide the changes/enhancements made to ODE by the OSF RI.

To conserve disk space, you can remove 234src.1.tar.Z at this point.

(optional, % rm 234src.1.tar.Z)

% zcat < 234src.2.tar.Z | tar xvpf -

(The full list of contents of the 2nd archive is shown at the end).

% ls -a
./               .sandboxrc       234src.2.tar.Z   src/
../              234src.1.tar.Z   rc_files/

If the tar commands complete without errors, both the *.tar.Z files can be
deleted, and you should proceed to Section 2 of the ODE System Administration
Guide: Building and Installing ODE.  You can obtain the updated PostScript
version of SAG, sag.ps, from riftp.osf.org:/ode/doc/*
along with other related ODE documentation.
