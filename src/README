This tree contains the source and documentation for the OSF Development
Environment (ODE) tools.  RCS version 5.6 is included in a separate archive.

We have not ported the RCS 5.6 sources to all of the machines listed above.
Our rcs servers in-house at OSF are currently running OSF/1, Ultrix,
and HP-UX.
