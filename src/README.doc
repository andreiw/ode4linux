This README.doc file describes the subset of ODE documentation that
currently resides on the FTP server under riftp.osf.org:/pub/ode/doc.

This subdirectory contains documentation in two forms: compressed Postscript
files and simple, non-graphical ASCII text versions.  The text files are
abridged, reduced versions of the entire guides provided here for convenience.
The full, complete version of the documentation (including diagrams) is
available in the *.ps.Z compressed Postscript files.

If your system provides text formatting tools (e.g. nroff/troff/tbl), you
can rebuild these documents using the Makefiles in the ./src/ode/doc tree.
