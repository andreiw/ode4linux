.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I
Getbool
is used to ask the user to type "yes" or "no".
.I
Prompt
is a string containing a message which will be printed;
the user types "yes", "y", etc., or "no", "n", etc.
in response to the question.
.I
Getbool
returns 1 if "yes" (etc.) is typed, 0 for "no".
If the user types just a carriage return, then
.I
defalt
is
returned.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

etc.
.br
.IR boolarg (3)
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
The user is informed if his response is not valid (e.g.
"maybe"),
and the prompt-and-response cycle is repeated.
.SH "BUGS"
There is no provision for an "escape" answer (e.g.
"I don't care").
