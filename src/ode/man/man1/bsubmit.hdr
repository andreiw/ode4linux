.SH FLAGS
.IP "\fB-auto_out\fR" 8
The default behavior of \fBbsubmit\fR is, after completing the submission,
to prompt the user to outdate the file(s) from the local set.
Outdating a file removes the local copy of the file from the set
as well as removing any reference to the file from the local BCS logs.
This option is used if the user does not want to get the prompt
for outdating, in other words, the outdating occurs \fBautomatically\fR.
To be sure that this option is really meant, it requires that both the
\fB-auto\fR and the \fB-auto_out\fR options are set, otherwise \fBbsubmit\fR
will still prompt the user.
.P
.ti 2
\fIlog opts\fR:
.IP "\fB-fn \fIfull name\fR" 8
String holding the user's full name, for example, "Suzie Que".
The name will have to be quoted to contain the space.
If this option is not used, \fBbsubmit\fR will prompt the user for this
information before creating the log message.
.IP "\fB-defect \fInumber\fR"
The number of the defect which this submission applies to.
Not all projects require this field, although, if the user provides it,
this information is always stored in the log.
If the project requires this field and this option is not used,
\fBbsubmit\fR will prompt the user for the information.
This field can contain a single number, multiple numbers, or be left empty.
.IP "\fB-log \fIlogfile\fR"
Replaces the standard logfile with the one given and enters it without
putting the user in an editor.
Normally, \fBbsubmit\fR takes the \fBbci\fR
log and has the submitter edit it to get the submission log.
This option takes the path and name of a file to use instead of the
\fBbci\fR log.
For relative paths, \fBbsubmit\fR
starts its search from the source directory of the sandbox.
.P
.IP "\fB\-info\fR"
\fB-info\fR gives the user information on what \fBbsubmit\fR would do
without actually doing anything.
The \fB-info\fR option works in conjunction with the verbosity options.
.P
.ti 2
\fIrecover opts\fR:
.IP "\fB-resub \fItime\fR"
This option is used to continue a \fBbsubmit\fR
which has been interrupted or failed.
To identify which submission to retry, \fBbsubmit\fR uses the environment
variable \fBUSER\fR and the time the submission began.
\fBbsubmit\fR lists the time information before it exits a failed submission.
.P
.IP "\fB-rm \fItime\fR"
This is the alternative to resubmitting. The \fB-rm\fR option removes the
work done so far and returns the source control system and backing build to
the state they were in prior to submission. This option does not work after
a submission has completed successfully since there is no guarantee that
other submissions have not occurred between the time that the submission
succeeded and \fBbsubmit -rm\fR was run. This functionality will be implemented
in a future release as \fBbsubmit -undo\fR.
.P
When doing a resubmission or a removal,
the list of files to process is NOT given as part of the \fB-resub\fR or
\fB-rm\fR options.
The files are retrieved from the hold file.
Other options, such as \fB-auto\fR work with \fB-resub\fR and \fB-rm\fR
including the \fB-info\fR option to preview the operation.
.IP "\fB-date \fIdate\fR"
Like the time and USER,
the date is used to identify the submission to be resubmitted or removed.
Since submissions and resubmissions or removals are normally made on the same
day,
today's date is used by default.
This option is used to override this default.
The form of the date is:
.B M/D/YY
where M is the number of the month, D is the number of the day of the
month, and YY is the two digit representation of the year.
.P
\fBbsubmit\fR submits files to the appropriate build for the project as
given in the sandbox's backing tree.
