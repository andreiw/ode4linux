2/8/94 ODE 2.3.4
----------------
Closed lots of defects
ODE now has a turn-key test suite which is available separately
Fixed lots of nits thanks to new test suite
Improved ancestry handling
Added -a switch to bco to enable users to check out old versions of a file
  and be able to bci and bsubmit it and preserve the fact that the file
  will probably need merging
Restored and improved bco -undo
Restored bci -x (xlog) functionality
Added bco -p to check out any version of a file to stdout
'bdiff -r ODE_LABEL' now prints branch labels (if supplied) before doing diffs.
Added a man page for odexm
Added a Buildconf.local file which works like the old 'local' file
Documented exclusive file locking, sb.conf, COPYRIGHT NOTICE handling,
  and make's .tryinclude
sadmin.1 and oderc reference pages were updated to conform with ODE 2.3 changes
Added VERROR for ui_print() as a level between VWARNING and VFATAL

6/11/93 ODE 2.3
-------------------------------------------------
Made source control and build parts separable
Added ancestor tracking. This simplifies shared sandboxes & resbing
Strict file locking (optional by directory)
New client/server architecture. Very fast bsubmits!!
Automatic history log merging
Configurable comment leaders
Uses RCS 56.
Fixed bugs
[See change_requests file for full list]

1/4/92 - ODE 2.2
-------------------------------------------------
Changed kxctd to odexm
Converted most tools to use the ODE parser
Converted the b-tools to use the sci_rcs.c module
Updated the test suite
Fixed bugs

===============================================================================
ODE 2.1.1
===============================================================================

General:
  Ported to hp700_hpux except for sup, build, diff
  Ported to sparc_sunos
  Fixed hanging authcovers in bci,bco,bmerge,bsubmit for > 8 files
  Uses new porting mechanism, PORTING_OFILES in Makeconf
  Now builds 'build' in setup.sh to support setup pass in OSF/1 1.1
  Updated documentation to reflect setup changes
  Added va_argv to libode/porting
  Added -version for all commands except make (see next line)
  Added -v for make to get version
  Fixed rcs Makefile to be able to build rcsdiff3 independently of other
    rcs programs
  Now gives credit to CMU for the code that came from CMU

authcover (rcsauth, srcauth, subauth)
  Cleaned up one of the calls to select which was giving 'invalid argument.'

bmerge
  Cleaned up casts of va_list to (char *) by using va_argv
 
bsubmit
  Fixed problems with (null) for versions in logs.
  Split backing builds now work.

logsubmit
  Fixed improper locking code which would sometimes prevent bsubmit.hold
  cleanup at the end of a submission.

make
  Fixed archive format code. Now builds OSF/1 1.1 libc.a correctly.
  Fixed problem which prevented leading whitespace from being stripped from
    command line.
  -k now really continues, even if no rules are defined for a target

makepath
  Now handles parallel building

release
  Fixed problem with dangling links and improper propagation of links to
  release areas.

sup
  Now built static and calls /sbin/sh (which is static)
  More portable (but still not perfect!)
