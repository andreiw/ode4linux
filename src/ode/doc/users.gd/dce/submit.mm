.H 1 "Submitting"
.P
Read "Chapter 4: Submitting"
in the ODE Users' Guide.
That chapter fully explains the process by which you submit changed source
files into the source management tree at OSF.
.P
Note that DCE development sites outside of
OSF do not necessarily use the ODE source management system.
